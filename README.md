Mr Mollusc is an online multiplayer world set during the ancient history of an alien planet.

The player, an explorer, is sent back in time from the far future, without a means to return.
As such, small, low tech communitues have been built up, struggling to survive the world.

The two main inspirations for this game are 2 other MMOs. Old School Runescapea and *some* parts of Entropia Universe.

[3.0] Skills

I would like skills to be both plentiful and grindy, EU has like a million skills which is far too much, but I
like the idea that it's not really expected to max a skill because it would realistically take so long.

A skills max level will be capped at 255. There will be less unlocks/level due to it just being too much content,
but an emphasis on incremental stat boosts to skill related activities would be nice, and serve as a way to continue 
training despite having technically "unlocked" everything.

Experience to level will follow OSRS and be exponential, however probably not to the same "doubling every 7 levels" extent, as that would be far too much.
