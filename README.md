[3.0] Skills

I would like skills to be both plentiful and grindy, EU has like a million skills which is far too much, but I
like the idea that it's not really expected to max a skill.

A skills max level will be capped at 255. There will be less unlocks/level due to it just being too much content,
but an emphasis on incremental stat boosts to skill related activities would be nice.

Experience to level will follow OSRS and be exponential, however probably not to the same "doubling every 7 levels" extent.
